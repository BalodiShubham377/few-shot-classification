# Few-Shot Learning with Prototypical Networks
### Overview
This repository contains code for implementing and training Prototypical Networks for few-shot learning tasks. Few-shot learning is a challenging problem where a model is trained to make accurate predictions on classes with very few examples during inference. Prototypical Networks provide an effective solution to this problem by learning a metric space where classes are represented by their prototypes, enabling efficient classification of query examples.

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```python
! pip install easyfsl
```

## Usage


. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR100
from easyfsl.samplers import TaskSampler
from easyfsl.models import PrototypicalNetworks
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

```

. Define your few-shot classification task using the provided Prototypical Networks implementation.
. Prepare your dataset. Example using CIFAR100:

```python 
image_size = 224
train_set = CIFAR100(
    root="./data",
    transform=transforms.Compose([
        transforms.RandomResizedCrop(image_size),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
    ]),
    download=True,
)
```

#### Explanation
Few-shot learning tasks involve classifying query examples based on a limited number of support examples per class. Prototypical Networks address this by learning a feature space where classes are represented by their prototypes, computed as the mean of support examples. Query examples are then classified based on their proximity to these prototypes.

### Dataset
The code provided here uses the CIFAR100 dataset for demonstration purposes. However, you can adapt it to your specific dataset by providing the appropriate data loading and preprocessing steps.
